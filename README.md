# IsCAn
[IsCAn](https://fredericpoitevin.github.io/IsCAn/.) scans and identifies interesting features in your dataset.

### IsCAn pdbs

Given a set of curated PDB files, and through a divide-and-zoomin strategy, *IsCAn pdbs* allows you to extract relevant structural states and the relevant modes bridging them.

### IsCAn trajs

**WIP** When the dataset is time-ordered, it has been shown that time-correlations can be used to yield a relevant summary. We compare with a method that ignores time-correlations, and try to infer some informations about the dynamics at play.

### IsCAn data

**WIP** More generally, the idea behind IsCAn can be used to extract signals from noisy datasets of any kind. We wish to illustrate this here.
